To use the fox captioner application you must first be logged in.

After logging in you are greeted with a random picture of a fox taken from the random fox api.

The page also lists the different types and breeds of foxes.

The user may then enter a caption for this specific picture.

The caption will then appear above the picture and the user can either decide to screenshot their created caption with the fox image for their own personal use, or refresh the page and start again.

## Challenges and Issues
There were struggles with getting the sumbit form to function correctly. I also had issues with connecting code between the models, controllers, and views files and at times didn't know where to put specific code.
